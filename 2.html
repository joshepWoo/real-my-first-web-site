<h2>CSS이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.

The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
such as JavaScript.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
cues for the appearance of the document.<br> HTML elements are the building blocks
of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.</br>
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
brackets. Tags such as and  directly introduce content
into the page.
Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text
and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML
tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
